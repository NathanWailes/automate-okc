# automate-okc

To Do:
 - have the scraper capable of working bit-by-bit (saving data as it goes) instead of needing to do everyone at once before it saves anything
 - Scrape your messages so the program knows who has responded to your messages.
 - Scrape the profile pictures and have some fast way of deciding if you want to contact them, so you don't have to keep using QuickMatch.
 - Have some way of automatically re-scraping the site every night to get any new profiles that may have come online.

Done:
 - See if there's some kind of API that could help you get information.
